# Vertex Cover Solver

The project's goal is to solve the VERTEX COVER problem in the best computational time.

## Download of test instances

The following command needs to be run in the "alg-eng-rosty-binetruy-1" directory.

```bash
curl -O http://fpt.akt.tu-berlin.de/alg-eng-data/data.zip
```

## Usage

```bash
bash run.sh
```

The benchmark.sh file is being called and its console output is saved into two timestamped files:
* ./history/yyyymmddHHMM_run_history.txt
* ./history/yyyymmddHHMM_run_history.csv
