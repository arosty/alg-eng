# Vertex Cover Solver

The project's goal is to solve the VERTEX COVER problem in the best computational time.

## Usage

```bash
bash run.sh
```

The benchmark.sh file is being called and its console output is saved into two timestamped files:
* ./history/yyyymmddHHMM_run_history.txt
* ./history/yyyymmddHHMM_run_history.csv
